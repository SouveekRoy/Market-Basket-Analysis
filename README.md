# Market-Basket-Analysis
Introduction Market Basket Analysis is one of the most common methods used by large retailers to discover product relationships. It operates by looking for things that are frequently found together in transactions. To put it another way, it enables businesses to discover connections between the things that customers purchase. Association Rules are commonly used to analyse retail basket or transaction data, and they are designed to find strong rules revealed in transaction data using measures of interest, based on the concept of strong rules. An example of Association Rules -Assume there are 100 customers -10 of them bought milk, 8 bought butter and 6 bought both of them. -bought milk => bought butter -support = P(Milk &amp; Butter) = 6/100 = 0.06 -confidence = support/P(Butter) = 0.06/0.08 = 0.75 -lift = confidence/P(Milk) = 0.75/0.10 = 7.5
